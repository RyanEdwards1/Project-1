### The IDE i used Was NotePad++

notepad ++ was a good option to use as it shows the syntax highlights with colours instead of normal notpad just showing the text
so this helped me out alot as i was able to see when i was correcting indenting things and making other syntaxs correctly aswell. 
Notepad++ also aloud us to preview it in many differnt browsers so we could check in real time to see if are code was working or not.

i also used a little bit of "Repl.it" as i got closer to the end of my code as this helped with displaying errors and helping me locate 
them it also saved time as it split the screen into two so i could see what i was changing live instead of tabing in and out of notpad 
and a web browser.
