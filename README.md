## Introduction
#### The aim of this project was to create a web based game. There are two characters: the player, and the enemy npc. The aim of the game is to keep your character away from the enemy, until a timer concludes. The player has three lives, if the enemy NPC hits the player they lose a life. When the player runs out of lives, the game ends

## Description
#### A non-playing character NPC (that is a character controlled by the computer) targets the users mouse position as the player moves across the screen, the game is over once the NPC touches the players mouse position 3 times
